        <summary>Lures for rockfish</summary>
        <p>Rockfish are vivacious eaters, they have poor eyesights and will generally attack anything they can see or smell.  Lures and bait are great options for them
            with lures being preferred as many rockfish species have to be returned to the water alive, and using bait risks gut hooking these creatures which is almost
            a guaranteed death for them.  Below are some of the lures that are effective for rockfish.
