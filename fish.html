        <summary>Why I prefer to bottomfish with barbless hooks</summary>
        <p>One of the many reasons why I prefer to fish with barbless hooks is because of the amount of snag you will encounter while fishing on
            the bottom for rockfish, lingcod, or any other species of bottomfish.  Usually, the bottomfish are plentiful enough that you do not need barbs 
            to limit out.  What is more likely to happen with barbed hooks though, is that you will lose more lures to snags to the point where you will 
            spend more time retying lures than actually fishing.

        <summary>What is a rockfish?</summary>
        <p class="rockfishInfo">A rockfish can be from one out of many species of rockfish, or the family of fish known as Sebastes.

        <summary>Lures for rockfish</summary>
        <p class="rockfishInfo">Rockfish are vivacious eaters, they have poor eyesights and will generally attack anything they can see or smell.  Lures and bait are great options for them
            with lures being preferred as many rockfish species have to be returned to the water alive, and using bait risks gut hooking these creatures which is almost
            a guaranteed death for them.  Below are some of the lures that are effective for rockfish.
